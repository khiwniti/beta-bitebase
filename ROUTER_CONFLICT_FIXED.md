# 🔧 Next.js Router Conflict - RESOLVED

## ✅ Issue Fixed: App Router vs Pages Router Conflict

### 🚨 **Problem**
```
Conflicting app and page file was found, please remove the conflicting files to continue:
  "pages/index.tsx" - "app/page.tsx"
```

### ✅ **Solution Applied**
1. **Removed conflicting Pages Router files**:
   - Deleted `pages/index.tsx`
   - Removed empty `pages/` directory

2. **Confirmed App Router structure**:
   - ✅ `app/page.tsx` (Landing page)
   - ✅ `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (Dashboard)
   - ✅ `app/restaurant-setup/page.tsx` (Setup wizard)
   - ✅ `app/market-analysis/page.tsx` (Market analysis)
   - ✅ `app/layout.tsx` (Root layout)

### 🎯 **Current Status**

#### **✅ Frontend Structure (App Router)**
```
apps/frontend/app/
├── page.tsx                 # Landing page (BiteBase Intelligence)
├── layout.tsx               # Root layout
